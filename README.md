****** Description of the project ******

• Most of the time, due to the fact that it is easier, you will be tempted to use one
password for all the services you are using.
• To be safer you should use a different password for each service in case of a data
leak but it is hard to remember all these passwords.
• This is the point of our app: store, manage and generate safe passwords for you.
This way you do not need to keep all of them in mind and you’re also able to use
longer and safer ones.
